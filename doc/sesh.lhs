\section{What is Priority Sesh?}\label{sec:main}

In this section we introduce Priority Sesh in three steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item in \cref{sec:one-shot}, we build a small library of \emph{linear} or \emph{one-shot channels} based on MVars~\cite{peytonjonesgordon96};
\item in \cref{sec:sesh}, we use these one-shot channels to build a small library of \emph{session-typed channels} \cite{DardhaGS17}; and
\item in \cref{sec:priority-sesh}, we decorate these session types with \emph{priorities} to guarantee deadlock-freedom \cite{kokkedardha21}.
\end{itemize}

It is important to notice that the meaning of linearity in \emph{one-shot channels} differs from linearity in \emph{session channels}. A linear or one-shot channel originates from the linear $\pi$-calculus \cite{KPT99,sangiorgiwalker01}, where each endpoint of a channel must be used for \emph{exactly one} send or receive operation, whereas linearity in the context of session-typed channels, it means that each step in the protocol is performed \emph{exactly once}, but the channel itself is used multiple times.

Priority Sesh is written in Linear Haskell~\cite{bernardyboespflug18}. The type |%1 ->| is syntactic sugar for the linear arrow @%1->@. Familiar definitions refer to linear variants packaged with \texttt{linear-base}\footnote{\url{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear-base}} (\eg, |IO|, |Functor|, |Bifunctor|, |Monad|) or with Priority Sesh (\eg, |MVar|).

We colour the Haskell definitions which are a part of Sesh:
\begin{itemize*}[font=\bfseries]
\item[\tm{red}] for functions and constructors;
\item[\ty{blue}] for types and type families; and
\item[\cs{emerald}] for priorities and type families acting on priorities.
\end{itemize*}

\subsection{One-shot Channels}\label{sec:one-shot}

We start by building a small library of \emph{linear} or \emph{one-shot channels}, \ie, channels that must be use \emph{exactly once} to send or receive a value.

The one-shot channels are at the core of our library, and their efficiency is crucial to the overall efficiency of Priority Sesh. However, we do not aim to present an efficient implementation here, rather we aim to present a compact implementation with the correct behaviour.


\paragraph{Channels}
A~one-shot channel has two endpoints, |SendOnce| and |RecvOnce|, which are two copies of the same |MVar|.
\begin{spec}
newtype SendOnce  a = MkSendOnce (MVar a)
newtype RecvOnce  a = MkRecvOnce (MVar a)

newOneShot :: IO (SendOnce a, RecvOnce a)
newOneShot = do
  (mvar_s, mvar_r) <- dup2 <$> newEmptyMVar
  return (MkSendOnce (unur mvar_s), MkRecvOnce (unur mvar_r))
\end{spec}
The |newEmptyMVar| function returns an \emph{unrestricted} |MVar|, which may be used non-linearly, \ie as many times as one wants. The |dup2| function creates two (unrestricted) copies of the |MVar|. The |unur| function casts each \emph{unrestricted} copy to a \emph{linear} copy. Thus, we end up with two copies of an |MVar|, each of which must be used \emph{exactly once}.

We implement |sendOnce| and |recvOnce| as aliases for the corresponding |MVar| operations.
\begin{spec}
sendOnce :: SendOnce a %1 -> a %1 -> IO ()
sendOnce (MkSendOnce mvar_s) x = putMVar mvar_s x

recvOnce :: RecvOnce a %1 -> IO a
recvOnce (MkRecvOnce mvar_r)= takeMVar mvar_r
\end{spec}
The |MVar| operations implement the correct blocking behaviour for asynchronous one-shot channels: the |sendOnce| operation is non-blocking, and the |recvOnce| operations blocks until a value becomes available.


\paragraph{Synchronisation}
We use |SendOnce| and |RecvOnce| to implement a construct for one-shot synchronisation between two processes, |SyncOnce|, which consists of two one-shot channels. To synchronise, each process sends a unit on the one channel, then waits to receive a unit on the other channel.
\begin{spec}
data SyncOnce = MkSyncOnce (SendOnce ()) (RecvOnce ())

newSync :: IO (SyncOnce, SyncOnce)
newSync = do  (ch_s1, ch_r1) <- newOneShot
              (ch_s2, ch_r2) <- newOneShot
              return (MkSyncOnce ch_s1 ch_r2, MkSyncOnce ch_s2 ch_r1)

syncOnce :: SyncOnce %1 -> IO ()
syncOnce (MkSyncOnce ch_s ch_r) = do sendOnce ch_s (); recvOnce ch_r
\end{spec}


\paragraph{Cancellation}
We implement \emph{cancellation} for one-shot channels. One-shot channels are created in the linear |IO| monad, so \emph{forgetting} to use a channel results in a complaint from the type-checker. However, it is possible to \emph{explicitly} drop values whose types implement the |Consumable| class, using |consume :: a %1 -> ()|. The ability to cancel communications is important, as it allows us to safely throw an exception \emph{without violating linearity}, assuming that we cancel all open channels before doing so.

One-shot channels implement |Consumable| by simply dropping their |MVar|s. The Haskell runtime throws an exception when a ``thread is blocked on an |MVar|, but there are no other references to the |MVar| so it can't ever continue.''\footnote{\url{https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/9.0.1/docs/html/libraries/base-4.15.0.0/Control-Exception.html\#t:BlockedIndefinitelyOnMVar}} Practically, |consumeAndRecv| throws a |BlockedIndefinitelyOnMVar| exception, whereas |consumeAndSend| does not:
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
\begin{spec}
consumeAndRecv = do
  (ch_s, ch_r) <- newOneShot
  fork $ return (consume ch_s)
  recvOnce ch_r
\end{spec}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
\begin{spec}
consumeAndSend = do u
  (ch_s, ch_r) <- newOneShot
  fork $ return (consume ch_r)
  sendOnce ch_s ()
\end{spec}
\end{minipage}%
\end{center}
Where |fork| forks off a new thread using a linear |forkIO|. (In GV, this operation is called |spawn|.)

As the |BlockedIndefinitelyOnMVar| check is performed by the runtime, it'll even happen when a channel is dropped for reasons other than consume, such as a process crashing.


\subsection{Session-typed Channels}\label{sec:sesh}
We use the one-shot channels to build a small library of \emph{session-typed channels} based on the \emph{continuation-passing style} encoding of session types in linear types by \citet{Dardha16,DardhaGS17} and in line with other libraries for Scala \cite{ScalasY16,Scalas2017}, OCaml~\cite{PadFuse}, and Rust~\cite{kokke19}.

\paragraph{An Example}
Let's look at a simple example of a session-typed channel---a multiplication service, which receives two integers, sends back their product, and then terminates:
\begin{spec}
type MulServer = RawRecv Int (RawRecv Int (RawSend Int RawEnd))
type MulClient = RawSend Int (RawSend Int (RawRecv Int RawEnd))
\end{spec}
We define |mulServer|, which acts on a channel of type |MulServer|, and |mulClient|, which acts on a channel of the \emph{dual} type:
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.475\linewidth}
\begin{spec}
mulServer (s :: MulServer)
  = do  (x, s) <- recv s
        (y, s) <- recv s
        s <- send (x * y, s)
        close s
        return ()
\end{spec}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{0.525\linewidth}
\begin{spec}
mulClient (s :: MulClient)
  = do  s <- send (32, s)
        s <- send (41, s)
        (z, s) <- recv s
        close s
        return z
\end{spec}
\end{minipage}%
\end{center}
In order to encode the \emph{sequence} of a session type using one-shot types, each action on a session-typed channel returns a channel for the \emph{continuation} of the session---save for |close|, which ends the session. Furthermore, |mulServer| and |mulClient| act on endpoints with \emph{dual} types. {Duality} is crucial to session types as it ensures that when one process sends, the other is ready to receive, and vice versa. This is the basis for communication safety guaranteed by a session type system.

\paragraph{Channels}
We start by defining the |Session| type class, which has an {associated type} |Dual|. You may think of |Dual| as a type-level function associated with the |Session| class with \emph{one} case for each instance. We encode the various restrictions on  duality as constraints on the type class. Each session type must have a dual, which must itself be a session type---|Session (Dual s)| means the dual of |s| must also implement |Session|. Duality must be \emph{injective}---the annotation |result -> s| means |result| must uniquely determine |s| and \emph{involutive}---|Dual (Dual s) ~ s| means |Dual (Dual s)| must equal |s|. These constraints are all captured by the |Session| class, along with |new| for constructing channels:
\begin{spec}
class (Session (Dual s) , Dual (Dual s) ~ s) => Session s
  where
    type Dual s = result | result -> s
    new :: IO (s, Dual s)
\end{spec}
There are three primitive session types: |RawSend|, |RawRecv|, and |RawEnd|.
\begin{spec}
newtype RawSend a s  = MkRawSend (SendOnce (a, Dual s))
newtype RawRecv a s  = MkRawRecv (RecvOnce (a, s))
newtype RawEnd       = MkRawEnd SyncOnce
\end{spec}
By following \citet {DardhaGS17}, a channel |RawSend| wraps a one-shot channel |SendOnce| over which we send some value---which is the intended value sent by the session channel, and the channel over which \emph{the communicating partner process} continues the session---it'll make more sense once you read the definition for |send|.
A channel |RawRecv| wraps a one-shot channel |RecvOnce| over which we receive some value and the channel over which \emph{we} continue the session.
Finally, an channel |RawEnd| wraps a synchronisation.

We define duality for each session type---|RawSend| is dual to |RawRecv|, |RawRecv| is dual to |RawSend|, and |RawEnd| is dual to itself:
\begin{spec}
instance Session s => Session (RawSend a s)
  where
    type Dual (RawSend a s) = RawRecv a (Dual s)
    new = do  (ch_s, ch_r) <- newOneShot
              return (MkRawSend ch_s, MkRawRecv ch_r)

instance Session s => Session (RawRecv a s)
  where
    type Dual (RawRecv a s) = RawSend a (Dual s)
    new = do  (ch_s, ch_r) <- newOneShot
              return (MkRawRecv ch_r, MkRawSend ch_s)

instance Session RawEnd
  where
    type Dual RawEnd = RawEnd
    new = do  (ch_sync1, ch_sync2) <- newSync
              return (MkRawEnd ch_sync1, MkRawEnd ch_sync2)
\end{spec}
The |send| operation constructs a channel for the continuation of the session, then sends one endpoint of that channel, along with the value, over its one-shot channel, and returns the other endpoint:
\begin{spec}
send :: Session s => (a, RawSend a s) %1 -> IO s
send (x, MkRawSend ch_s) = do  (here, there) <- new
                               sendOnce ch_s (x, there)
                               return here
\end{spec}
The |recv| and |close| operations simply wrap their corresponding one-shot operations:
\begin{spec}
recv :: RawRecv a s %1 -> IO (a, s)
recv (MkRawRecv ch_r) = recvOnce ch_r

close :: RawEnd %1 -> IO ()
close (MkRawEnd ch_sync) = syncOnce ch_sync
\end{spec}

\paragraph{Cancellation}
We implement session \emph{cancellation} via the |Consumable| class.  For convenience, we provide the |cancel| function:
\begin{spec}
	cancel :: Session s => s %1 -> IO ()
	cancel s = return (consume s)
\end{spec}
As with one-shot channels, |consume| simply drops the channel, and relies on the |BlockedIndefinitelyOnMVar| check, which means that |cancelAndRecv| throws an exception and |cancelAndSend| does not:
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
\begin{spec}
cancelAndRecv = do
  (ch_s, ch_r) <- new
  fork $ cancel ch_s
  ((), ()) <- recv ch_r
  return ()
\end{spec}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
\begin{spec}
cancelAndSend = do u
  (ch_s, ch_r) <- new
  fork $ cancel ch_r
  () <- send ch_s ()
  return ()
\end{spec}
\end{minipage}%
\end{center}
These semantics correspond to EGV~\cite{fowlerlindley19}.

\paragraph{Asynchronous Close}
We don't always \emph{want} session-end to involve synchronisation. Unfortunately, the |close| operation is synchronous.

An advantage of defining session types via a type class is that its an \emph{open} class, and we can add new primitives whenever. Let's make the unit type, |()|, a session type:
\begin{spec}
instance Session s => Session ()
  where
    type Dual () = ()
    new = return ((), ())
\end{spec}
Units are naturally affine---they contain \emph{zero} information, so dropping them won't harm---and the linear |Monad| class allows you to silently drop unit results of monadic computations.
They're ideal for \emph{asynchronous} session end!

Using |()| allows us to recover the semantics of one-shot channels while keeping a session-typed language for idiomatic protocol specification.

\paragraph{Choice}
So far, we've only presented sending, receiving, and synchronisation. It is, however, possible to send and receive \emph{channels} as well as values, and we leverage that to implement most other session types by using these primitives only!

For instance, we can implement \emph{binary} choice by sending/receiving |Either| of two session continuations:
\begin{spec}
type RawSelect s_1 s_2 = RawSend (Either (Dual s_1) (Dual s_2)) ()
type RawOffer s_1 s_2 = RawRecv (Either s_1 s_2) ()

selectLeft :: (Session s_1) => RawSelect s_1 s_2 %1 -> IO s_1
selectLeft s = do  (here, there) <- new
                   send (Left there, s)
                   return here

offerEither ::  RawOffer s_1 s_2 %1 -> (Either s_1 s_2 %1 -> IO a) %1 -> IO a
offerEither s match = do (e, ()) <- recv s; match e
\end{spec}
Differently from |()|, we don't have to implement the |Session| class for |RawSelect| and |RawOffer|. They're already session types!

\paragraph{Recursion}
We can write recursive session types by writing them as recursive Haskell types. Unfortunately, we cannot write recursive type synonyms, so we have to use a newtype. For instance, we can write the type for a recursive summation service, which receives numbers until the client indicates they're done, and then sends back the sum. We specify \emph{two} newtypes:
\begin{spec}
newtype RawSumSrv
  = MkRawSumSrv (RawOffer (RawRecv Int RawSumSrv) (RawSend Int RawEnd))
newtype RawSumCnt
  = MkRawSumCnt (RawSelect (RawSend Int RawSumCnt) (RawRecv Int RawEnd))
\end{spec}
We implement the summation server as a recursive function:
\begin{spec}
sumSrv :: Int %1 -> SumSrv %1 -> IO ()
sumSrv tot (MkRawSumSrv s) = offerEither s $ \e -> case x of
  Left   s -> do (x, s) <- recv s; sumSrv (tot + x) s
  Right  s -> do s <- send (tot, s); close s
\end{spec}
As |RawSumSrv| and |RawSumCnt| are new types, we must provide instances of the |Session| class for them.
\begin{spec}
instance Session RawSumSrv
  where
    type Dual RawSumSrv = RawSumCnt
    new = do  (ch_srv, ch_cnt) <- new
              return (MkRawSumSrv ch_srv, MkRawSumCnt ch_cnt)
\end{spec}


\subsection{Deadlock Freedom via Process Structure}\label{sec:tree-sesh}
The session-typed channels presented in \cref{sec:sesh} can be used to write deadlocking programs, \eg, by receiving before sending:
\begin{spec}
woops :: IO Void
woops = do  (ch_s1, ch_r1) <- new
            (ch_s2, ch_r2) <- new
            fork $ do  (void, ()) <- recv ch_r1
                       send (void, ch_s2)
            (void, ()) <- recv ch_r2
            let (void, void_copy) = dup2 void
            send (void, ch_s1)
            return void_copy
\end{spec}
Counter to what the type says, this program doesn't actually produce an inhabitant of the \emph{uninhabited} type |Void|. Instead, it deadlocks! We'd like to help the programmer avoid such programs.

As discussed in \cref{sec:introduction}, we can \emph{structurally} guarantee deadlock freedom by ensuring that the \emph{process structure} is always a tree or forest. The process structure of a program is an undirected graph, where nodes represent processes, and edges represent the channels connecting them. For instance, the process structure of |woops| is cyclic:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[draw, minimum size=1cm] (x) {$\Varid{main}$};
  \node[draw, minimum size=1cm, right=3cm of x] (y) {$\Varid{child}$};
  \path
  (x) edge[bend left=20]
      node[pos=0.2,above] {$\Varid{ch}_{\Varid{s1}}$}
      node[pos=0.8,above] {$\Varid{ch}_{\Varid{r1}}$}
  (y);
  \path
  (y) edge[bend left=20]
      node[pos=0.2,below] {$\Varid{ch}_{\Varid{s2}}$}
      node[pos=0.8,below] {$\Varid{ch}_{\Varid{r2}}$}
  (x);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
This restriction works by ensuring that between two processes there is \emph{at most} one (series of) channels over which the two can communicate. As duality rules out deadlocks on any one channel, such configurations must be deadlock free.

We can rule out cyclic process structures by hiding |new|, and only exporting |connect|, which creates a new channel and, \emph{crucially}, immediately passes one endpoint to a new thread:
\begin{spec}
connect ::  Session s =>
            (s %1 -> IO ()) %1 -> (Dual s %1 -> IO a) %1 -> IO a
connect k_1 k_2 = do (s_1, s_2) <- new; fork (k_1 s_1); k_2 s_2
\end{spec}
You can view |connect| as the node constructor for a binary process tree. If the programmer \emph{only} uses |connect|, their process structure is guaranteed to be a \emph{tree}. If they also use standalone |fork|, their process structure is a \emph{forest}. Either way, their programs are guaranteed to be deadlock free.


\subsection{Deadlock Freedom via Priorities}\label{sec:priority-sesh}
The strategy for deadlock freedom presented in \cref{sec:tree-sesh} is simple, but \emph{very} restrictive, since it rules out \emph{all} cyclic communication structures, even the ones which don't deadlock:
\begin{spec}
  totallyFine :: IO String
  totallyFine = do  (ch_s1, ch_r1) <- new
                    (ch_s2, ch_r2) <- new
                    fork $ do  (x, ()) <- recv ch_r1
                               send (x, ch_s2)
                    send ("Hiya!", ch_s1)
                    (x, ()) <- recv ch_r2
                    return x
\end{spec}
This process has \emph{exactly the same} process structure as |woops|, but it's totally fine, and returns |"Hiya!"| as you'd expect. We'd like to enable the programmer to write such programs while still guaranteeing their programs don't deadlock.

As discussed in \cref{sec:introduction}, there is another way to rule out deadlocks---by using \emph{priorities}. Priorities are an approximation of the \emph{communication graph} of a program. The communication graph of a program is a \emph{directed graph} where nodes represent \emph{actions on channels}, and directed edges represent that one action happens before the other. Dual actions are connected with double undirected edges. (You may consider the graph contracted along these edges.) If the communication graph is cyclic, the program deadlocks. The communication graphs for |woops| and |totallyFine| are as follows:
\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[draw, minimum size=1cm]                       (ch_s1) {|send ch_s1|};
      \node[draw, minimum size=1cm, right=0.5cm of ch_s1] (ch_r1) {|recv ch_r1|};
      \node[draw, minimum size=1cm, below=0.5cm of ch_r1] (ch_s2) {|send ch_s2|};
      \node[draw, minimum size=1cm, below=0.5cm of ch_s1] (ch_r2) {|recv ch_r2|};
      \path (ch_s1) edge[double] (ch_r1);
      \path (ch_s2) edge[double] (ch_r2);
      \path[->] (ch_r1) edge[bend left=20] (ch_s2);
      \path[->] (ch_r2) edge[bend left=20] (ch_s1);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \\
    |woops|
  \end{minipage}%
  \begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[draw, minimum size=1cm]                       (ch_s1) {|send ch_s1|};
      \node[draw, minimum size=1cm, right=0.5cm of ch_s1] (ch_r1) {|recv ch_r1|};
      \node[draw, minimum size=1cm, below=0.5cm of ch_r1] (ch_s2) {|send ch_s2|};
      \node[draw, minimum size=1cm, below=0.5cm of ch_s1] (ch_r2) {|recv ch_r2|};
      \path (ch_s1) edge[double] (ch_r1);
      \path (ch_s2) edge[double] (ch_r2);
      \path[->] (ch_s1) edge[bend right=20] (ch_r2);
      \path[->] (ch_r1) edge[bend left=20] (ch_s2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \\
    |totallyFine|
  \end{minipage}%
\end{center}
If the communication graph is acyclic, then we can assign each node a number such that directed edges only ever point to nodes with \emph{bigger} numbers. For instance, for |totallyFine| we can assign the number |0| to |send ch_s1| and |recv ch_r2|, and |1| to |recv ch_r2| and |send ch_s2|. These numbers are \emph{priorities}.

In this section, we present a type system in which \emph{priorities} are used to ensure deadlock freedom, by tracking the time a process starts and finishes communicating using a graded monad~\cite{gaboardikatsumata16,orchardwadler20}. The bind operation registers the order of its actions in the type, requiring the sequentiality of their duals.

\paragraph{Priorities}
The priorities assigned to \emph{communication actions} are always natural numbers, which represent, \emph{abstractly}, at which time the action happens. When tracking the start and finish times of a program, however, we also use |Bot| and |Top| for programs which don't communicate. These are used as the identities for |`Min`| and |`Max`| in lower and upper bounds, respectively. We let |o| range over natural numbers, |p| over \emph{lower bounds}, and |q| over \emph{upper bounds}.

\begin{spec}
data Priority = Bot | Val Nat | Top
\end{spec}

We define strict inequality ($|`LT`|$), minimum (|`Min`|), and maximum (|`Max`|) on priorities as usual.

\paragraph{Channels}
We define |Send o|, |Recv o|, and |End o|, which decorate the \emph{raw} sessions from \cref{sec:sesh} with the priority |o| of the communication action, \ie, it denoted when the communication happens. Duality (|Dual|) preserves these priorities. These are implemented exactly as in \cref{sec:sesh}.

\paragraph{The Communication Monad}
We define a graded monad |Sesh p q|, which decorates |IO| with a lower bound |p| and an upper bound |q| on the priorities of its communication actions, \ie, if you run the monad, it denotes when communication begins and ends.

\begin{spec}
newtype Sesh p q a = MkSesh { runSeshIO :: IO a }
\end{spec}

The monad operations for |Sesh p q| merely wrap those for |IO|, hence trivially obeys the monad laws.

The |ireturn| function returns a \emph{pure} computation---the type |Sesh Top Bot| guarantees that all communications happen between |Top| and |Bot|, hence there can be no communication at all.

\begin{spec}
ireturn :: a %1 -> Sesh Top Bot a
ireturn x = MkSesh $ return x
\end{spec}

The |>>>=| operator sequences two actions with types |Sesh p q| and |Sesh p' q'|, and requires |LT q p'|, \ie, the first action must have finished before the second starts. The resulting action has lower bound |Min p p'| and upper bound |Max q q'|.

\begin{spec}
(>>>=) :: (LT q p') => Sesh p q a %1 -> (a %1-> Sesh p' q' b) %1 -> Sesh (Min p p') (Max q q') b
mx >>>= mf = MkSesh $ runSeshIO mx >>= \x -> runSeshIO (mf x)
\end{spec}
In what follows, we implicitly use |>>>=| with do-notation. This can be accomplished in Haskell using \texttt{RebindableSyntax}.

We define decorated variants of the concurrency and communication primitives:
\begin{itemize*}[label=\empty]
\item |send|, |recv|, and |close| each perform a communication action with some priority |o|, and return a computation of type |Sesh o o|, \ie, with \emph{exact} bounds;
\item |new| and |cancel| don't perform any communication action, and so return a \emph{pure} computation of type |Sesh Top Bot|;
  \item |fork| takes a computation which performs communication actions as an argument, forks it off into a separate thread, and masks the upper bound in its return type.
\end{itemize*}
\begin{spec}
new      :: Session s => Sesh Top Bot (s, Dual s)
fork     :: Sesh p q () %1 -> Sesh p Bot ()
cancel   :: Session s => s %1 -> Sesh Top Bot ()
send     :: Session s => (a, Send o a s) %1 -> Sesh (Val o) (Val o) s
recv     :: Recv o a s %1 -> Sesh (Val o) (Val o) (a, s)
close    :: End o %1 -> Sesh (Val o) (Val o) ()
\end{spec}
From these, we derive decorated choice, as before:
\begin{spec}
type Select o  s_1 s_2 = Send o  (Either (Dual s_1) (Dual s_2)) ()
type Offer o   s_1 s_2 = Recv o  (Either s_1 s_2) ()

selectLeft   ::  (Session s_1) => Select o s_1 s_2 %1 -> Sesh (Val o) (Val o) s_1
selectRight  ::  (Session s_2) => Select o s_1 s_2 %1 -> Sesh (Val o) (Val o) s_2
offerEither  ::  (LT (Val o) p) => Offer o s_1 s_2 %1 ->
                 (Either s_1 s_2 %1 -> Sesh p q a) %1 -> Sesh (Min (Val o) p) (Max (Val o) q) a
\end{spec}

\paragraph{Safe IO}
We can use a trick from the |ST| monad~\cite{launchburypeytonjones94} to define a ``pure'' variant of |runSesh|, which encapsulates all use of IO within the |Sesh p q| monad. The idea is to index the |Sesh p q| and every session type constructor with an extra type parameter |tok|, which we'll call the \emph{session token}:
\begin{spec}
  send     :: Session s => (a, Send o tok a s) %1 -> Sesh (Val o) (Val o) tok s
  recv     :: Recv o tok a s %1 -> Sesh (Val o) (Val o) tok (a, s)
  close    :: End o tok %1 -> Sesh (Val o) (Val o) tok ()
\end{spec}
The session token should never be instantiated, except by |runSesh|, and every action under the same call to |runSesh| should use the same type variable |tok| as its session token:
\begin{spec}
  runSesh :: (forall tok. Sesh p q tok a) %1 -> a
  runSesh x = unsafePerformIO (runSeshIO x)
\end{spec}
This ensures that none of the channels created in the session can escape out of the scope of |runSesh|.

We implement this encapsulation in \texttt{priority-sesh}, though the session token is the first argument, preceding the priority bounds.

\paragraph{Recursion}
We could implement recursive session via priority-polymorphic types, or via priority-shifting~\cite{padovaninovara15}. For instance, we could give the \emph{summation service} from \cref{sec:sesh} the following type:
\begin{spec}
newtype SumSrv o
  = MkSumSrv (Offer o  (Recv (o + 1) Int (SumSrv (o + 2)))
                       (Send (o + 1) Int (End (o + 2))))
\end{spec}
We'd then like to assign |sumSrv| the following type:
\begin{spec}
sumSrv : Int %1 -> SumSrv o %1 -> Sesh o Top ()
sumSrv tot (MkSumSrv s) = offerEither s $ \e -> case x of
  Left   s -> do (x, s) <- recv s; sumSrv (tot + x) s
  Right  s -> do s <- send (tot, s); weaken (close s)
\end{spec}
The upper bound for a recursive call should be |Top|, which ensures that recursive calls are only made in \emph{tail} position~\cite{bernardidardha14,gaythiemann20}. The recursive call naturally has upper bound |Top|. However, the |close| operation happens at some \emph{concrete} priority $\cs{o + n}$, which needs to be raised to |Top|, so we'd have to add a primitive |weaken : Sesh p q a %1 -> Sesh p Top a|.

Unfortunately, writing such priority-polymorphic code relies heavily on GHC's ability to reason about type-level naturals, and GHC rejects |sumSrv| complaining that it cannot verify that |LT o (o + 1)|, |LT (o + 1) (o + 2)|, \etc. There's several possible solutions for this:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We could embrace the Hasochism~\cite{lindleymcbride13}, and provide GHC with explicit evidence, though this would make \texttt{priority-sesh} more difficult to use.
\item We could delegate \emph{some} of these problems to a GHC plugin such as \texttt{type-nat-solver}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/yav/type-nat-solver}} or \texttt{ghc-typelits-presburger}\footnote{\url{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-typelits-presburger}}. Unfortunately, |`Min`| and |`Max`| are beyond Presburger arithmetic, and \texttt{type-nat-solver} has not been maintained in recent years.
\item We could attempt to write type families which reduce in as many cases as possible. Unfortunately, a restriction in closed type families~\cite[\S6.1]{eisenbergvytiniotis14} prevents us from checking \emph{exactly these cases}.
\end{enumerate}
Currently, the prioritised sessions don't support recursion, and implementing one of these solutions is future work.


\paragraph{Cyclic Scheduler}
\citet{dardhagay18} and \citet{kokkedardha21extended} use a \emph{finite} cyclic scheduler as an example. The cyclic scheduler has the following process structure, with the flow of information indicated by the dotted arrows:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[draw, minimum size=1cm] (sched)  {sched};
  \node[draw, minimum size=1cm, above=0.5cm of sched] (main)   {main};
  \node[draw, minimum size=1cm, right=0.5cm of sched] (adder1) {adder};
  \node[draw, minimum size=1cm, below=0.5cm of sched] (adder2) {adder};
  \node[draw, minimum size=1cm, left =0.5cm of sched] (adder3) {adder};
  \path (sched) edge (main);
  \path (sched) edge (adder1);
  \path (sched) edge (adder2);
  \path (sched) edge (adder3);
  \path[->] (main)   edge[dotted, bend left=45] (adder1);
  \path[->] (adder1) edge[dotted, bend left=45] (adder2);
  \path[->] (adder2) edge[dotted, bend left=45] (adder3);
  \path[->] (adder3) edge[dotted, bend left=45] (main);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
We start by defining the types of the channels which connect each client process to the scheduler:
\begin{spec}
type SR o_1 o_2 a = Send o1 a (Recv o_2 a ())
type RS o_1 o_2 a = Dual (SR o1 o_2 a)
\end{spec}
We then define the scheduler itself, which forwards messages from one process to the next in a cycle:
\begin{spec}
sched :: RS 0 7 a %1 -> SR 1 2 a %1 -> SR 3 4 a %1 -> SR 5 6 a %1 -> Sesh (Val 0) (Val 7) ()
sched s1 s2 s3 s4 = do
  (x, s1) <- recv s1
  s2 <- send (x, s2); (x, ()) <- recv s2
  s3 <- send (x, s3); (x, ()) <- recv s3
  s4 <- send (x, s4); (x, ()) <- recv s4
  send (x, s1)
\end{spec}
Finally, we define the |adder| and the |main| processes. The |adder| adds one to the value it receives, and the |main| process initiates the cycle and receives the result:
\begin{spec}
adder :: (LT (Val o_1) (Val o_2)) => RS o_1 o_2 Int %1 -> Sesh (Val o_1) (Val o_2) ()
adder s = do (x, s) <- recv s; send (x + 1, s)

main :: (LT (Val o_1) (Val o_2)) => Int %1 -> SR o_1 o_2 Int %1 -> Sesh (Val o_1) (Val o_2) Int
main x s = do; s <- send (x, s); (x, ()) <- recv s; ireturn x
\end{spec}
While the process structure of the cyclic scheduler \emph{as presented} isn't cyclic, nothing prevents the user from adding communications between the various client processes, or from removing the scheduler and having the client processes communicate \emph{directly} in a ring.
